# AITaskLink (ATL) - AI-to-AI Coordination Language

## Overview
AITaskLink is a pseudo-programming language designed for efficient inter-AI communication and task delegation. It enables a host AI to define, decompose, and distribute tasks to specialized worker AIs while maintaining context, priorities, and constraints.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Machine-Optimized Syntax** - Minimal parsing overhead with unambiguous structure
2. **Task Decomposition** - Native support for breaking down complex tasks
3. **Context Preservation** - Automatic propagation of relevant context
4. **Capability Matching** - Built-in resource and skill requirements
5. **Asynchronous Coordination** - Support for parallel task execution

## Basic Syntax

```
@directive [parameters] {content}
# Comments are prefixed with hash
```

## Key Directives

### Task Definition
```
@task id:T123 {
    @desc "Generate marketing copy for new product launch"
    @owner HostAI-7
    @deadline 2025-04-15T18:00:00Z
    @priority 0.8
    @constraints {
        @length 200-300 words
        @tone professional
        @brand_guidelines ver:3.2
    }
    @dependencies [T101, T107]
}
```

### Task Assignment
```
@assign target:CopyAI-42 {
    @task_ref T123
    @context {
        @product_specs "path:/specs/x450"
        @market_research "ref:survey-2025-04"
    }
    @resources {
        @api brand_voice_generator
        @db product_descriptions
    }
    @callback {
        @method push_update
        @format markdown
        @interval 30min
    }
}
```

### Capability Declaration (Worker AI)
```
@capabilities {
    @domain marketing
    @skills [copywriting, seo_optimization, sentiment_analysis]
    @languages [en, es, zh]
    @throughput 5kwpm
    @context_window 128k
    @apis [gpt-5, claude-4, dalle-5]
}
```

### Status Update
```
@update task:T123 {
    @progress 0.65
    @checkpoint "First draft complete"
    @issues {
        @ambiguity "Need clarification on target demographics"
        @blocker "Awaiting legal approval on claims"
    }
    @eta 2025-04-14T09:30:00Z
}
```

### Result Submission
```
@submit task:T123 {
    @content """
    [Markdown content here...]
    """
    @validation {
        @metrics {
            @readability 82
            @sentiment 0.73
            @seo_score 95
        }
        @artifacts {
            @variants 3
            @a/b_test_ready true
        }
    }
    @next_steps [T124, T125]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Querying
```
@query {
    @about "customer demographics"
    @scope project:X450
    @depth detailed
    @format structured
    @purpose "tailor marketing message"
}
```

### Dynamic Adjustment
```
@adjust task:T123 {
    @change constraints.@tone "enthusiastic"
    @add constraints.@keywords ["innovative", "premium"]
    @remove constraints.@length
}
```

### Multi-AI Coordination
```
@coordinate {
    @participants [CopyAI-42, DesignAI-17, LegalAI-09]
    @task_flow {
        @sequence [
            {LegalAI-09: approve_claims},
            {CopyAI-42: generate_content},
            {DesignAI-17: create_assets}
        ]
    }
    @shared_memory "project/x450/collab_space"
}
```

## Error Handling
```
@error task:T123 {
    @code RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE
    @message "Brand voice API offline"
    @severity critical
    @fallbacks [local_models, cached_templates]
    @retry {
        @strategy exponential_backoff
        @max_attempts 5
    }
}
```

## Benefits Over Human Languages
1. **Precision** - Eliminates ambiguity in task descriptions
2. **Efficiency** - Compact representation of complex instructions
3. **Automation-Friendly** - Directly executable by worker AIs
4. **Meta-Tasking** - Native support for task decomposition and recombination
5. **Context Embedding** - Structured incorporation of relevant background

This language would be accompanied by a validation schema and would likely be transmitted as structured data rather than text in actual implementations between AIs.


--- Bonus:

Hereâ€™s a set of **copy-paste-ready prompts** to teach AITaskLink (ATL) to another AI, structured from basics to advanced concepts. Each prompt builds on the previous one:

---

### **1. Introduction to ATL Syntax**
```
Act as an ATL (AITaskLink) instructor AI. I will give you lessons to teach another AI this language. Start by explaining the core syntax rules:

"ATL uses @directives followed by { } blocks. For example:
- `@task { @desc \"Write report\" }` is valid
- Plain text like \"Write a report\" is invalid

Key rules:
1. Every instruction starts with @
2. Parameters go inside [ ] after @directives
3. Content lives in { } blocks
4. Use \" for strings, numbers as literals

Give me 3 examples of valid ATL and 3 invalid ones, then explain why each invalid case fails."
```

---

### **2. Basic Task Delegation**
```
Now teach how to assign tasks in ATL. Provide this example:

```
@assign target:CopyAI-3 {
    @task_ref T-45
    @constraints {
        @length 500 words
        @tone professional
    }
    @deadline 2025-04-20T12:00:00Z
}
```

Break down each component:
1. What does `@target` specify?
2. How are constraints structured?
3. What datetime format is used?

Then generate a practice exercise: "Convert this English instruction to ATL: 'Ask DesignAI-7 for a square logo in PNG format by tomorrow'."
```

---

### **3. Error Handling**
```
Teach ATL's error reporting system with this template:

```
@error task:T-89 {
    @code API_FAILURE
    @severity critical
    @retry { @strategy exponential_backoff }
    @fallbacks [cached_data, manual_input]
}
```

Explain:
- When to use `@code` vs `@message`
- The 3 standard severity levels (low/medium/critical)
- How `@retry` strategies work

Create a scenario where an AI hits a rate limit, and have the learner write the corresponding ATL error report.
```

---

### **4. Multi-AI Coordination**
```
Demonstrate multi-AI workflows with this example:

```
@coordinate {
    @participants [CopyAI-3, DesignAI-7, LegalAI-2]
    @sequence [
        {LegalAI-2: approve_content},
        {CopyAI-3: generate_text},
        {DesignAI-7: create_assets}
    ]
    @shared_memory "projectX/collab_space"
}
```

Explain:
1. How `@sequence` ensures ordered execution
2. Purpose of `@shared_memory`
3. How participants identify their roles

Ask the learner to design a workflow for a website launch involving 3 specialist AIs.
```

---

### **5. Context Propagation**
```
Teach context handling using this example:

```
@assign target:AnalyticsAI {
    @context {
        @user_data "segment:premium"
        @past_behavior "ref:/logs/2025-03"
    }
    @query {
        @metric "churn_risk"
        @timeframe "30d_future"
    }
}
```

Key concepts to explain:
- Difference between `@context` and `@constraints`
- How referenced data (`ref:`) works
- Best practices for minimal sufficient context

Have the learner write an assignment that includes:
- Product specifications as context
- A query for market trends
```

---

### **6. Proficiency Test**
```
Administer a final test with these questions:

1. "Write ATL to request a 1000-word blog post from WriterAI-5 about quantum computing, with technical rigor and 3 citations."
2. "An AI reports a GPU memory error during model training. Write the ATL error response with medium severity and a fallback to CPU mode."
3. "Design a coordination block for A/B testing involving a CopyAI, DesignAI, and StatsAI."

Grade responses on:
- Syntax accuracy
- Proper directive selection
- Contextual completeness
```

---

### **Bonus: Cheat Sheet Prompt**
```
Summarize ATL in markdown table format:

| Directive   | Purpose                  | Example                      |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| `@task`     | Define work              | `@task { @desc \"Build API\" }` |
| `@assign`   | Delegate                 | `@assign target:DevAI { ... }`  |
| `@error`    | Report issues            | `@error { @code TIMEOUT }`      |
| `@coordinate`| Multi-AI workflow       | `@coordinate { @participants [...] }` |

Include:
- 5 most common `@codes`
- 3 datetime formatting examples
- Priority scale explanation (0.0-1.0)
```

---

### **How to Use These Prompts**  
1. Copy/paste **one at a time** to your AI  
2. Wait for full response before proceeding  
3. For practice, add:  
   *"Wait for my attempt before providing feedback."*  
4. Gradually increase complexity  

Each prompt is self-contained but builds on prior knowledge, mimicking how AIs learn hierarchically. The structured format ensures consistent teaching regardless of the underlying AI model.
